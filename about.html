                 <h2>Artist Bio:</h2>
                 <p>Melissa&apos;s journey has always revolved around being creative. Inspired by a drawing of a fawn her childhood sweet heart drew for her when she was just 12 years old. 
                 She first learned to draw using the <em>Learn to Draw</em> books she borrowed from a neighbor when she was 13 years old.
                 Getting her first camera when she was around 15 years of age, inspired her even further.
                 She took a ceramics class in high school and was put in advanced art class her senior year.
                 She went on to Polk Community college to persue a degree in Art, graduating with an AA degree.
                 She continued college, graduating from Florida State with a BS in Studio Art in 1997.
                 She took up oil painting, photography and ceramics while at Florida State University.
                 Melissa is currently attending Polk State College for an AS degree in Graphic Design and is learning about Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
